 Welcome
============


The church in Kennesaw, USA warmly welcomes you. We are believers in the Lord Jesus Christ who have personally received Him as our Savior. He is the most excellent and enjoyable Person. We love Him and endeavor to give Him the first place in all things. We rejoice to be cleansed by the blood of Jesus, God’s Son, born again of the Father’s divine life, and filled with the Holy Spirit.We highly treasure the Holy Bible as God’s revelation of Himself and of His eternal purpose.

We hold the common faith which is revealed in the Bible and is common to all genuine believers. As is true of all believers in Christ, we are members of His one Body,the church. In order to practice the oneness of the Body with all the Christians in small city, we meet as the church in small city. We are in fellowship with over 3,000 local churches worldwide to express the one Body of Christ.

For government registration and reporting purposes, we are incorporated as the local church of the saints in Kennesaw.
