         <h1>ABOUT US</h1><br>
           <p style="text-align: justify;">As individual believers in Christ, we seek to live a life that glorifies our Savior and Lord Jesus Christ, denying ungodliness and putting off the <strong>“old man”</strong> to live according to the life and nature of Christ who indwells us.
           </p><br><p>Christianity is not, strictly speaking, a religion teaching people to do this and to do that. It is simply Christ Himself, the living One, being wrought into us</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">As members of the body of Christ, we seek to live a   corporate life by laying aside all distinctions and divisive practices, expressing the one, universal body of Christ in a practical, local way but in fellowship with all the local churches on the earth. We have been especially helped, both individually and collectively, by the ministry of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee, and wholeheartedly recommend their ministry to all seekers of the Lord.</p>
