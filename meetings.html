          <h3>SMALL GROUPS</h3>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">Our small groups are at the heart of our church life and community. Small groups are characterised by a vital spiritual pursuit, an intimate loving atmosphere, and a committed goal of spiritual fruit-bearing (John 15:12-17). Groups organically form and develop across the city, across all ages, and across all ethnicities.</p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;">While we treasure the larger Sunday gatherings where the whole church comes together, the small groups add a more personal and daily component to our church lives..</p>

          <h3>CHILDREN MEETING</h3>

         <div class="col-sm-8"><br><br><br>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Our children’s work (K-6th) takes as a starting point the realization that every child is a gift from God and has been created to contain God and express God. Our focus is to cultivate a proper humanity in each of our children. Our goal during this stage of their lives is that each of our children would have a soft heart that loves and honors God. Our weekly children’s lessons include age-appropriate curriculum consisting of Bible stories, timeless character lessons, fun children’s songs, and personal shepherding.</p>

         <div class="col-sm-8"><br><br><br>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Our hope is that during their teenage years, each of our children would personally receive the Lord as his or her Savior, have a meaningful baptism experience, develop a taste for the living Word of God, learn how to contact God in spirit and truthfulness, be preserved and sanctified in their personal lives, be built with others into the church, and grow in the divine life of God.</p>

         <div class="col-sm-8"><br><br><br>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">With each other as their spiritual companions, our college students love to read the Bible, sing hymns, pray, serve in the church, preach the gospel, and shepherd younger believers. If you are a college student in LA, chances are that we have brothers and sisters in school with you!
